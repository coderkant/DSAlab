# Find the Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
# If you were only permitted to buy one share of the stock and sell one share of the
# stock, design an algorithm to find the best times to buy and sell.
#
# Ex:
# Input = {6,1,3,2,4,7}
# Output : time to buy = at index 1(value = 1)
#              time to sell  = at index 5(value = 7)
#              max profit   = 7 - 1 = 6
